# syntheticCT
Create synthetic CT images from CBCT

# TODO
- Improve exisiting deformable image registrations
    - Crop registration volume vs external in the structureset
    - Determine bspline dimensions from dimensions of external -> end up at resolution ~ 2 cm in the bspline grid? 
    
- Test elastix deformable image registrations
    - similar as above
    - bone rigidity possible?
